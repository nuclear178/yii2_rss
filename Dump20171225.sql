Oshurt, of Millcreek, in a Salt Lake <a class=\"selected-link\" href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/letters/2017/12/12/letter-whats-the-point-of-the-lewinsky-event-in-park-city/\" title=\"\">Tribune Public Forum letter</a> last week, which prompted more than 100 <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/pb/opinion/letters/2017/12/12/letter-whats-the-point-of-the-lewinsky-event-in-park-city/comments/\">online comments</a>.</p>\n<p>Those comments prompted a Google alert to mortgage-industry executive Vincent Valvo, who placed a call to Orr.</p>\n<p>Valvo, of Agility Resources Group, told Orr he was familiar with such questions. After Lewinsky broke her public silence with a buzzy 2014 Vanity Fair essay and her headline-grabbing 2015 TED talk “The Price of Shame,” he contracted her to speak at an industry conference. At the news of her booking, sponsors pulled their support, to the tune of $10,000.</p>\n<p>But Lewinsky’s speech was so well-received, Valvo booked her again. And this month he called Orr to offer $1,500 to pay for tickets for women who cannot afford to attend.</p>\n<p>The Park City talk is Lewinsky’s first public ticketed event, after high-profile talks at TED and other conferences, Orr says. Park City Institute’s full-page newspaper ads feature a provocatively simple photo of Lewinsky staring straight into the camera, and it serves as the centerpiece of the performing-arts group’s 20th-anniversary season lineup.</p>\n<p>Orr understands the questions. Settling into the auditorium before Lewinsky’s 2015 speech, she thought TED organizers had lost their edge. She joked that they must be planning to book the Kardashians next.</p>\n<p>But listening to Lewinsky’s talk, which prompted a lengthy standing ovation and went on to receive millions of page views, changed Orr’s mind. Lewinsky agreed to the speech and an outreach session with Park City young women, but so far has turned down advance media requests.</p>\n<p>The talk follows Park City Institute’s high-profile <a href=\"http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3270149&amp;itype=CMSID\">remote conversation with Edward Snowden</a> last year; the former U.S. intelligence officer and contractor who leaked classified documents, which he says exposed illegal government spying, is now in exile in Russia.</p>\n<p>“She’s the tour guide to how we talk to our kids about social media and cyberbullying, because she was patient zero for that,” Orr says, borrowing Lewinsky’s label. “Now, she’s aggressively taking control of her own narrative.”</p>\n<p>In her TED talk, Lewinsky, who in 2006 earned a master’s degree in social psychology from the London School of Economics, explains how her name came to be spun as, among other things, a common rap lyric.</p>\n<p>At 22, she was a White House intern who “fell in love with my boss,” who just happened to be U.S. President Bill Clinton. “At the age of 24, I learned the devastating consequences,” Lewinsky says, after 20 hours of private phone conversations about the affair, secretly recorded by co-worker and friend Linda Tripp, were handed over to independent counsel Kenneth Starr and then released to Congress, aired on TV, with excerpts posted online.<br></p>\n<p>“In 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance, I was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before,” she said in her TED talk. “What that meant for me personally was that overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide. I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously.”</p>\n<p>The conservative Drudge Report website came to public attention with its January 1998 report on the scandal, which named Lewinsky. “This scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution,” she says.</p>\n<p>Tickets for the speech are selling well, yet Orr has heard complaints from people who vowed the Lewinsky booking would mean they would no longer support institute events. When she looked up the complainers’ names, she could find no record of their financial support in the past.<br></p>\n<p>Orr hopes the talk sparks a larger conversation, especially as it is timed during this #MeToo season, when women are coming forward to talk about being harassed and silenced by powerful men in Hollywood, politics and other fields. Perhaps what makes this era most extraordinary is that women are being listened to.<br></p>\n<p>“I hope we gain the value of seeing with new eyes, that we revisit something we thought we knew, and learn we didn’t really understand it at all,” Orr says of Lewinsky’s speech. “That there’s always a story behind the story.”<br></p>\n<p><b>“The Price of Shame” •</b> Monica Lewinsky speaks at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 6, at Eccles Performing Arts Center, 1750 Kearns Blvd, Park City.&lt;br&gt;<b>Tickets •</b> $29, $49 and $79, at parkcity.institute or 435-655-3114&lt;br&gt;<b>More •</b> If people aren’t interested in hearing Lewinsky, Orr directs them to other powerful speakers and performers on this season’s lineup, such as writer Anne Lamott on Feb. 3, singer-songwriter Dar Williams on Feb. 24, or ACLU executive director Anthony Romero on April 3.</p>\n',NULL,NULL,91,'35a15cfe94526fe23dc6ea665de37038'),(225,'2017-12-25 01:38:54','Pope Francis on Christmas: Bethlehem trek is like today’s migrations as refugees flee ‘Herods’ of the world','\n<p><b>Vatican City •</b> Pope Francis in Christmas Eve remarks Sunday likened the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem to t...','\n<p><b>Vatican City •</b> Pope Francis in Christmas Eve remarks Sunday likened the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem to the migrations of millions of people today who are forced to leave homelands for a better life, or just for survival, and he expressed hope that no one will feel “there is no room for them on this Earth.”</p>\n<p>Francis celebrated late evening Christmas vigil Mass in the splendor of St. Peter’s Basilica, telling the faithful that the ‘’simple story” of Jesus’ birth in a manger changed “our history forever. Everything that night became a source of hope.”</p>\n<p>Noting that Mary and Joseph arrived in a land ’’where there was no place for them,” Francis drew parallels to contemporary time.</p>\n<p>“So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,” he said in his homily. “We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away but, driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones.</p>\n<p>“In many cases this departure is filled with hope, hope for the future; yet for many this departure can only have one name: survival,” the pope said.</p>\n<p>Referring to the king of Judea who was depicted as a tyrant in the New Testament, Francis continued, saying some migrants are “surviving the Herods of today, who, to impose their power and increase their wealth, see no problem in shedding innocent blood.”</p>\n<p>Francis has made concern for economic migrants, war refugees and others on society’s margins a central plank of his papacy. He said God is present in ’’the unwelcomed visitor, often unrecognizable, who walks through our cities and our neighborhoods, who travels on our buses and knocks on our door.” That perception of God should develop into ’’new forms of relationship, in which none have to feel that there is no room for them on this Earth,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Christmas is a time for turning the power of fear into the power of charity,” Francis said.</p>\n<p>Referring to Jesus as the Child of Bethlehem, the pope said that God ’’invites us to become sentinels for all those bowed down by the despair born of encountering so many closed doors.”</p>\n<p>The pope expressed hope that people see Jesus in ’’all those who arrive in our cities, in our histories, in our lives.”</p>\n<p>At the start of the service, Francis bent over to kiss a statue of the baby Jesus in the basilica.</p>\n<p>At midday Monday, tradition calls for Francis to deliver the Christmas Day message ’’urbi et orbi” — Latin for “to the city and to the world” — from the central loggia of the basilica overlooking St. Peter’s Square. The speech often is a review of the world events and conflicts.</p>\n',NULL,NULL,91,'6dab1337ae36dca9b0d8b13f86fb626c'),(226,'2017-12-25 01:16:15','Letter of the Week: My great fear is the state wants to pave Hole in the Rock Road','\n<p>I’ve been visiting the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) area for decades.

President Trump’s attacks on GSENM and Bears Ears National Monument are infuriating, but I’ve been taking comfort in the fact that there’s no legal basis for Trump’s action, because only Congress can reduce or rescind national monuments. Thus, I figured the courts would save the monuments.</p>\n<p>Well, enter Rep. Chris Stewart, who is proposing legislation that would make the proposed reduction of GSENM permanent while throwing in the token gesture of a small national park (5 percent of the monument). This legislation would make any pending lawsuits against Trump’s GSENM reduction moot. It should be seen as monument reduction legislation, not national park creation legislation.</p>\n<p>One of the most worrying parts of the legislation is that it turns <a class=\"\" href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2017/12/23/will-giving-the-state-control-of-historic-hole-in-the-rock-road-pave-the-way-for-crowds-and-development/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Hole-in-the-Rock Road over to the state</a>. For years I’ve thought that one of the worst things that could happen to GSENM would be for the state to gain control of this road and then pave it over. This road and the spectacular canyons accessed from it represent the heart of the monument. Paving it would permanently alter the monument experience, and not for the better. One of the things that makes GSENM so special is that it’s not as paved over and overrun by tourists as our national parks have become. If the state gains control of Hole-in-the-Rock Road, I’m sure it would be paved, and then further development would follow.</p>\n<p>When the idea of a Hole-in-the-Rock state park was floated in the state Legislature this past year, the fate of Hole-in-the-Rock Road was the first thing that came to my mind. Then Trump’s proclamation cut all of Hole-in-the-Rock Road out of the monument, making me even more suspicious. Stewart’s proposed legislation confirms my fears by turning the entire road over to the state.</p>\n<p>I hope members of the Congress who care about this unique and irreplaceable landscape see through this sham. A small, overcrowded national park isn’t worth cutting GSENM in half while tearing out its heart and handing it over to the state.</p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Eyre, Salt Lake City</i></p>\n',NULL,NULL,91,'24b323ad161acb3d187af11dce90b13c'),(227,'2017-12-25 01:10:11','NFL roundup: Saints beat Falcons, clinch NFC playoff berth','\n<p><b>New Orleans • </b>Rookie cornerback Marshon Lattimore corralled an unusual, momentum-turning interception off his back,...','\n<p><b>New Orleans • </b>Rookie cornerback Marshon Lattimore corralled an unusual, momentum-turning interception off his back, New Orleans made two defensive stands from inside its 2-yard line, and the Saints clinched their first playoff berth since 2013 with a 23-13 victory over the rival Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>Ted Ginn caught a 54-yard pass for a touchdown, which came a few plays after Lattimore\'s interception and shortly before halftime. Mark Ingram used a sharp cutback to break loose for a 26-yard touchdown for New Orleans ( 11-4), which kept its tenuous hold on first place in the NFC South heading into the final week of the season.</p>\n<p>While the loss eliminated the Falcons (9-6) from the NFC South race, Atlanta can clinch a wild-card berth by beating Carolina in the final regular-season game on New Year\'s Eve.</p>\n<p>The Falcons entered the game with a second straight division crown in their grasp, but they needed to beat the Saints. They squandered chances spectacularly, much to the delight of a deafening Superdome crowd — and certainly to the chagrin of scattered fans wearing Falcons red. The Falcons were taunted on their way to the game by a plane towing a banner that read \"28-3 Merry Xmas,\" a reference to Atlanta\'s Super Bowl collapse.</p>\n<p>Atlanta trailed 6-0 when Lattimore\'s interception of Matt Ryan set the Saints up to double their lead.</p>\n<p>But early in the third quarter, Atlanta linebacker Deion Jones intercepted a passed that deflected off of Ginn\'s hands and returned it 41 yards to the New Orleans 2. Devonta Freeman fumbled on a hit by Tyeler Davison two plays later and linebacker Manti Teo recovered.</p>\n<p>Drew Brees completed 21 of 28 passes for 239 yards. Brees became the third quarterback in NFL history to eclipse 70,000 career yards passing, joining Peyton Manning and Brett Favre.</p>\n<p>Ryan was 22 of 36 for 288 yards. He was sacked five times, twice by Cameron Jordan.</p>\n<p>Seahawks beat Cowboys 21-12 in playoff elimination game<br></p>\n<p><b>Arlington, Texas •</b> Justin Coleman put Seattle in front for good with a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown and the Seahawks won a playoff elimination game against Dallas, beating the Cowboys in Ezekiel Elliott’s return from a six-game suspension.</p>\n<p>Dak Prescott threw two interceptions and the Dallas offense didn’t score a touchdown despite the reunion with his backfield mate, the one he shared a remarkable rookie season with a year ago when Cowboys had an NFC-best 13 wins.</p>\n<p>Now Dallas (8-7) is eliminated from the postseason with the end of its three-game winning streak, and the Seahawks (9-6) still have a chance to keep their five-year playoff streak alive after Russell Wilson threw for two touchdowns despite a career-low 93 yards passing.</p>\n<p>Coleman gave Seattle a 14-9 lead in the third quarter when he reached down to catch Prescott’s badly overthrown pass to Elliott and ran untouched 30 yards for a touchdown.</p>\n<p>It was the fourth pick-six of the season for Prescott, who threw just four interceptions last season when he was the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He has 13 interceptions for the season.</p>\n<p>The Seahawks were eliminated in the NFC West race by the Los Angeles Rams’ 27-23 win at Tennessee. But they can still make the postseason with some help despite gaining just 136 total yards — their fewest since getting 135 in a 14-9 win over the St. Louis Rams in 2013.</p>\n<p>Elliott finished with 97 yards on 24 carries.<br></p>\n<p><b>49ers 44, Jaguars 33 • </b>In Santa Clara, Calif., Jimmy Garoppolo threw two touchdown passes and ran for a third score against one of the NFL’s stingiest defenses and San Francisco won its fourth straight behind its new quarterback, beating Jacksonville.</p>\n<p>The day wasn’t a total loss for the Jaguars (10-5), who clinched their first division title since 1999 earlier in the afternoon when Tennessee lost at home to the Rams. But the defeat dealt a big blow to Jacksonville’s hopes for a first-round bye. The Jaguars need to win next week and hope Pittsburgh loses twice to get a bye.</p>\n<p>The 49ers (5-10) saw their playoff hopes die a long time ago during an 0-9 start but the mood and play around the team changed dramatically after Garoppolo was inserted into the starting lineup earlier this month following a midseason trade from New England.</p>\n<p>He has led San Francisco to four straight wins but this one might have been the most impressive, considering the quality of Jacksonville’s defense. The Jaguars came into the game having allowed the fewest points and yards passing in the league, while recording the most sacks.</p>\n<p>Garoppolo carved Jacksonville up, completing 21 for 30 passes for 242 yards with TD throws to George Kittle and Trent Taylor as San Francisco pulled away in the second half. Garoppolo improved to 6-0 in his career as a starter.</p>\n<p><b>Cardinals 23, Giants 0 • </b>In Glendale, Ariz., Larry Fitzgerald had a big day in what might have been the final home game of his prolific career and Arizona shut out an opponent for the first time in 25 seasons in a victory over Eli Manning and New York.</p>\n<p>Fitzgerald, an 11-time Pro Bowl selection in his 14 NFL seasons, caught nine passes for 119 yards and a touchdown. He even completed a pass for the first time (in three career tries), a 21-yarder to Jaron Brown.</p>\n<p>Manning, on the other hand, could not get the offense moving for the Giants (2-13) and got no help on the ground.</p>\n<p>The 36-year-old quarterback completed 27 of 45 passes for 263 yards and was intercepted twice, both by Antoine Bethea. Manning also had the ball stripped by Deone Bucannon and returned 21 yards for a touchdown by Robert Nkemdiche.</p>\n<p>Arizona had not shut out an opponent since a 17-0 win over the Giants on Dec. 12, 1992. The Giants were last shut out on Oct. 12, 2014, 27-0 by the Eagles.</p>\n<p>The only real New York threat came when Aldrick Rojas missed a 33-yard field goal.</p>\n<p>With the victory for Arizona (7-8), Bruce Arians moved into a tie with Ken Whisenhunt for most victories by a Cardinals coach (49).</p>\n<p><b>Panthers 22, Buccaneers 19 • </b>In Charlotte, N.C., Cam Newton scored on a 2-yard run with 35 seconds remaining to lift the Panthers into the NFC playoffs.</p>\n<p>The Panthers (11-4) trailed most of the second half, but Newton drove them 59 yards, completing 4 of 7 passes for 52 yards in the final three minutes before scoring on a what could have been a game-ending play. Newton fumbled the snap from the shotgun, alertly picked it up and then dived across the goal line for the go-ahead score.</p>\n<p>Newton celebrated the score by using the football as a prop, pretending to light a candle on a cake in celebration of his son Chosen\'s 2nd birthday.</p>\n<p>Carolina can clinch the NFC South championship with a win over Atlanta and a New Orleans loss to Tampa Bay.</p>\n<p>The Panthers sealed the game when Kawann Short sacked Jameis Winston on Tampa Bay\'s final drive, and forced a fumble that Julius Peppers recovered. Winston threw for 367 yards and a touchdown but was sacked six times and fumbled three times. The Bucs are 4-11.</p>\n<p><b>Rams 27, Titans 23 • </b>In Nashville, Tenn., Jared Goff threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cooper Kupp in the fourth quarter and the Rams held off Tennessee to clinch their first NFC West title since 2003.</p>\n<p>The Rams (11-4) came in needing a win or a loss by Seattle to secure the division. They took care of business themselves, with Todd Gurley and Goff leading the way again.</p>\n<p>Gurley bolstered his argument for NFL MVP with 118 yards rushing and 158 yards receiving with two TDs. Goff finished with four touchdowns and 301 yards passing.</p>\n<p>The Titans (8-7) lost their third straight game, damaging their chances of ending their own playoff drought stretching to 2008.</p>\n<p>The Titans had the ball and a chance to win late in the game. On fourth-and-4 at the Rams 44, Marcus Mariota rolled right and chucked the ball incomplete under pressure from Connor Barwin.</p>\n<p><b>Chiefs 29, Dolphins 13 • </b>In Kansas City, Mo., Alex Smith threw for 304 yards and a touchdown, Kareem Hunt ran for 91 yards and a score and the Chiefs clinched back-to-back AFC West titles for the first time in franchise history.</p>\n<p>Tyreek Hill had six catches for 109 yards, and Harrison Butker converted five field goals, as the Chiefs (9-6) dashed what faint postseason hope the Dolphins (6-9) still harbored.</p>\n<p>Jay Cutler threw for 286 yards and a touchdown, but a chunk of that came on a 65-yard toss to Jakeem Grant late in the first half. Otherwise, Miami struggled against a defense that has been stingy and opportunistic the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>That\'s coincided with the return of Marcus Peters from his disciplinary suspension.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs\' star cornerback had two interceptions and forced a fumble against the Chargers last week, a win that pushed them to the brink of the playoffs. He recovered a fumble and forced another on Sunday, giving Peters a hand in five turnovers the past two weeks.</p>\n<p><b>Patriots 37, Bills 16 •</b> In Foxborough, Mass., Tom Brady passed for a pair of touchdowns and the Patriots stayed on track to claim home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.</p>\n<p>Dion Lewis caught a touchdown pass and rushed for a 4-yard score. He carried 24 times for a career-high 129 yards. It was just his second-career 100-yard game. Mike Gillislee, active for the first time in six games, added a 1-yard rushing touchdown</p>\n<p>New England (12-3) can lock up first-round bye with either a Pittsburgh or Jacksonville loss.</p>\n<p>Even with the loss, the Bills (8-7) remain in contention to break their 17-year playoff drought. It is longest active streak in North America\'s four major professional sports. It is the longest postseason absence since NFL merger in 1970.</p>\n<p>New England has won at least 12 games in eight straight seasons — an NFL record.</p>\n<p>Buffalo stayed close throughout and went into halftime locked in a 13-13 tie. But the Bills managed just three points in the final 30 minutes, after a touchdown at the end of the first half was taken away.</p>\n<p>Trailing 13-10, Buffalo was in position to take the lead, but an apparent 4-yard touchdown pass from Tyrod Taylor to Kelvin Benjamin in the corner of the end zone was overturned after an official review.</p>\n<p>NFL vice president of officiating Al Riveron said in a Twitter post Benjamin was juggling the ball and was only able to get one of his feet down before completing the catch.</p>\n<p><b>Chargers 14, Jets 7 • </b>In East Rutherford, N.J., Philip Rivers threw a touchdown pass to Antonio Gates and Melvin Gordon ran for a score, and the Chargers stayed alive in the AFC playoff race.</p>\n<p>The Chargers (8-7) entered the weekend needing to win both of their remaining games — including next Sunday at home against Oakland — and get lots of help elsewhere to remain in the mix. Rivers &amp; Co. held up their end of things, but barely.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles, which started the season 0-4, had a tough time getting much going against a spirited effort by the defense of the Jets (5-10). Rivers finished 22 of 40 for 290 yards.</p>\n<p>Gordon had 81 yards on 19 carries, but left late in the game with an ankle injury. He remained standing on the sideline as the Chargers tried to run out the clock.</p>\n<p>Bryce Petty, making his second start this season in place of the injured Josh McCown, struggled all game. He missed open receivers and repeatedly flexed his right hand, which he banged up early in the game. But he remained in, going 15 of 28 for 119 yards and an interception.</p>\n<p>Bilal Powell was the bright spot for the Jets\' offense, rushing for 145 yards, including a 57-yard TD, on 19 carries.</p>\n<p><b>Bengals 26, Lions 17 •</b> In Cincinnati, Giovani Bernard ran for 116 yards and a clinching touchdown in the closing minutes that eliminated the Lions from playoff contention and gave Marvin Lewis a good moment in what was possibly his final home game as Bengals coach.</p>\n<p>Matthew Stafford and the Lions (8-7) couldn\'t take advantage of an injury-depleted team that gave indifferent performances the last two games. It was a fitting finish for Detroit, which opened the season 3-4 and repeatedly wasted chances to move to the forefront of the playoff chase.</p>\n<p>Tion Green\'s 5-yard touchdown drive put the Lions ahead 17-16 early in the fourth quarter, but defensive penalties extended Cincinnati\'s drive that led to Randy Bullock\'s go-ahead kick with 4:42 left.</p>\n<p>Given one last chance, Detroit self-destructed with a holding penalty, a false start and a short punt, allowing the Bengals (6-9) to finish it off in front of a half-empty stadium.</p>\n<p><b>Bears 20, Browns 3 • </b>In Chicago, the Browns got pushed to the brink of a winless season, hurt by two more interceptions by DeShone Kizer and two turnovers in the red zone against Chicago.</p>\n<p>One more loss and the Browns will join the 2008 Detroit Lions as the only teams to go 0-16. Last year, Cleveland was 0-14 before getting its only victory on Dec. 24.</p>\n<p>And the Browns will wrap up the season at AFC North leader Pittsburgh next week. Then again, the Browns (0-15) keep racking up losses no matter whom they\'re playing.</p>\n<p>They\'re 1-30 in two seasons under coach Hue Jackson.</p>\n<p>Rookie QB Kizer threw for 182 yards and ran his league leading-interception total to 21. One of those was to a wide-open Kyle Fuller in the end zone in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Defensive end Myles Garrett had what looked like a 42-yard interception return for a touchdown early in the third quarter wiped out because Carl Nassib was offside.</p>\n<p>Rashard Higgins lost a fumble near the goal line that Chicago (5-10) recovered in the end zone.</p>\n<p><b>Washington 27, Broncos 11 •</b> In Landover, Md., Kirk Cousins threw for 299 yards and three touchdowns in what could be his final home game for Washington.</p>\n<p>Cousins was 19 of 37 with TD passes to Jamison Crowder, Josh Doctson and Vernon Davis and an interception. He became the first quarterback in Washington history with three seasons of 25 or more TD passes, and needs 65 yards for his third in a row with 4,000-plus yards.</p>\n<p>Washington\'s 386 offensive yards are third most by a Denver opponent this season, behind only Philadelphia and New England.

Wright, the widely read biblical scholar and former Anglican bishop, captures its import by noting that the Gospels do not cast Jesus as “parachuting down from a great height to dispense solutions to all problems nor zapping everything into shape like some kind of Superman.”</p>\n<p>Rather, Wright observes in his book “Simply Good News,” Christ is shown as “living in the mess and muddle of a very difficult part of the world at an especially difficult moment in its history and absorbing the pain and the shame of it all within his own life, within his own body.”</p>\n<p>Everything about the Christmas account portrays a world turned upside down. A new king heralded as the Son of God comes into the world quite inauspiciously, born in a manger surrounded by farm animals as part of a working-class family. This is a radical inversion of how God or gods were typically understood at the time: mighty and all-powerful beings, lording it over often hapless humans. The Christmas story is about God becoming one of us, and a particularly humble member of our company at that.</p>\n<p>This is why Christmas has always been a fundamentally subversive holiday, and why Christianity, an organic outgrowth of prophetic Judaism, has always been at root a radical faith.</p>\n<p>The joy of the day and the season isn’t felt only by those who hold the theological conviction that Jesus came to save the world from sin. It is also thrilling to the sorts of people whom the buoyantly radical folksinger Woody Guthrie described as his inspiration and primary audience — those casually dismissed as “born to lose.”</p>\n<p>“I am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world,” Guthrie said of his people, “and that if it has hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops, no matter what color, what size you are, how you are built, I am out to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work.”</p>\n<p>Christmas is the day for those who have been knocked for a dozen loops. Its good tidings are that the bad tidings about them are wrong. This is <i>their</i> world, too.</p>\n<p>As an unabashed fan of virtually every schmaltzy Christmas television moment, I have long appreciated how popular culture’s instincts about what the day represents are, perhaps surprisingly, fully in keeping with the Gospel’s insurrectionary implications.</p>\n<p>This is true despite the commercialization of the holiday, and despite efforts to politicize the question of who should say “Merry Christmas” to whom. (I confess to finding it decidedly un-Christian to insist on aggressively pushing Christmas greetings onto those whose own religious commitments are different from mine.)</p>\n<p>“It’s a Wonderful Life” is all about George Bailey triumphing over Mr. Potter. The unassuming Building-and-Loan guy beats the money-grubbing banker who doesn’t care a whit about his community. The people in the town whom Mr. Potter sees as losers rescue the man who wants them to win.</p>\n<p>The Grinch believes that the dear people of Whoville could have their Christmas ruined if only he hauled away all the stuff they expect as gifts. But Whoville is about love, not stuff, and even the Grinch’s heart has to respond. The Rudolph story lifts up the misfits over the conformists. In “Love Actually,” a British prime minister risks it all for his feelings toward a low-level staffer of modest origins. Choosing love over status is as Christmas as it gets.</p>\n<p>In preparation for the commemoration of Christ’s birth, the Roman Catholic calendar of readings for the Third Sunday of Advent this year included this passage from the 61st chapter of Isaiah:</p>\n<p><i>He has sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor</i></p>\n<p><i>To heal the broken-hearted</i></p>\n<p><i>To proclaim liberty to the captives and release to the prisoners</i></p>\n<p>You don’t have to be Jewish to experience the liberating message of the Exodus story. And you don’t have to be a Christian to feel elation over the idea that a fallen world can be redeemed. The poor, the broken-hearted, the captives and the prisoners do not have to be left to their fate and their suffering. Every year at this time, we are called to renew our hope that cold indifference and smug complacency can be overcome by a humble and gentle love powerful enough to inspire wise men, shepherds, and even angels.</p>\n<img alt=\"E.J.

That’s a big step to say that they’ll always have a female candidate in the pool.”</p>\n<p>The ParityPledge, which launched in September, has no quotas, no deadlines and no watchdog; it’s designed to be “very simple, seamless, frictionless,” Stickney said.</p>\n<p>Utah companies like the approach: 28 of the 61 companies that have signed on so far are based in the state.</p>\n<p> Susan Madsen, a Utah Valley University business professor and project director of the <a href=\"http://www.uvu.edu/uwlp/\">Utah Women and Leadership Project</a>, says committing to interview at least one woman for higher-level positions would be a shift for many businesses.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t sound like much does it? ‘Oh, have one woman,’” she said. “But actually, this is a big change, and I believe that it’s quite a big change for Utah.”</p>\n<p><b>SOME OF THE UTAH BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SIGNED THE PARITY PLEDGE:</b>&lt;br&gt; • Domo • InsideSales.com • Overstock • Pluralsight • Qualtrics • BambooHR • Banyan • Blacksmith • Cotopaxi • HireVue • RizePoint • Instructure • WCF Insurance • Envision Utah • Experticity<br></p>\n<p>‘We think we can do better’<br></p>\n<p> Overstock.com is likely the norm, not the outlier, when it comes to gender representation in top business leadership in Utah.

Acknowledging that, Stickney said she encourages businesses to interview more than one woman in those circumstances.</p>\n<p>Interviewing more women is “really a minimum,” Madsen said. “You can ... sign on [to a pledge], but if your practices don’t move forward in terms of recruiting and promotion and family-friendly policies and some of those other things, then it’s not going to make a difference long term.”</p>\n<p>Other initiatives as Overstock.com include onsite day care, expanded maternity leave policies and formal mentorship and leadership development programs, Tuohig said.</p>\n<p>Utah-based online education company Pluralsight has made the pledge, but it also has other programs to increase diversity, such as hiring a head of diversity and inclusion, said Anita Grantham, its chief people officer.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been here now for 18 months and even before the ParityPledge, our leadership team has always wanted diversity at our senior level,” Grantham said.</p>\n<p>Pluralsight has two female executives in its C-suite: Grantham and Chief Marketing Officer Heather Zynczak.</p>\n<p>Grantham said the fact that so many Utah companies have joined the ParityPledge shows there’s a desire to change the perception of the state as unfriendly for working women.</p>\n<p>“For me as a working female, there’s no better place for me to be than in Utah,” said Grantham, who came to the state from Arizona. “I think with Utah companies getting on board with this first, it shows the rest of the world that we are really committed to diversity, regardless of what perceptions may be.”</p>\n<p>‘We have a baseline for how we should all act’</p>\n<p> When <a href=\"http://www.womentechcouncil.com/\">Women Tech Council</a> co-founder and President Cydni Tetro started a 3-D printing company four years ago, half the members of her executive team were women.</p>\n<p>She’s since sold that business and started <a href=\"http://forgedx.com/\">ForgeDX</a>, where 75 percent of her executive team is women. <br></p>\n<p>Why?

One global survey <a href=\"https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf\">analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics</a> studied nearly 22,000 firms from over 90 countries and found “that the presence of women in corporate leadership positions may improve firm performance,” which could reflect the “payoff to nondiscrimination” or an increase in skill diversity.</p>\n<p>But unconscious biases — as well as social and cultural expectations that influence women’s choices in the workplace — may keep corporations from tapping women’s skills, Madsen said.</p>\n<p>As she teaches about how socialization affects gender perception, she invites students to say what they think of when shown certain words. “Just yell it out,” she says, holding up the word ‘leader.’</p>\n<p>“Man,” the class replies.</p>\n<p>Next, she holds up the word CEO. “Male,” they chorus.</p>\n<p>Those biases don’t leave the room during an interview, Madsen explained.</p>\n<p>“It’s very natural to hire someone who looks like you,” she said. Most executives are white men. “If you’re not conscious, you’re going to do that — just hire white men.”</p>\n<p>After companies are encouraged to interview women, Stickney thinks, progress will follow.</p>\n<p>“Our whole goal here is to not just interview women but to have them hired — but we don’t have a quota to hire them because we want [companies] to select the best person possible,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We think when they have really great, qualified women in front of them, they’re going to hire a woman.”</p>\n<p><b>The origins of the ParityPledge:</b>&lt;br&gt; In 2002, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers noticed a problem: though most of the players in the National Football League (NFL) were black, most of their managers and coaches were white.&lt;br&gt; In an effort to change that, Dan Rooney made a simple request: that all teams interview at least one black candidate for every coach or manager positions. In three years, the NFL saw an increase in black representation in those roles, though progress seems to have stalled since 2012.</p>\n',NULL,NULL,91,'5d18d933f3638e3f1880048eceb3ba13'),(232,'2017-12-24 23:15:45','These heroic rats detect land mines.

Fortunately, a big...','\n<p>The pangolin, an endangered anteater that is one of the world\'s most poached animals, could use a hero. Fortunately, a big rat is training for the job.</p>\n<p>Actually, 11 African giant pouched rats are. At a research center in central Tanzania, the 2-foot-long rodents are learning to detect the smell of pangolins\' armor-like scales, which are smuggled to Asia for use in sham traditional remedies. If the rats succeed, they and their twitching noses could eventually deploy to ports, national park borders and even highways to sniff out illegal shipments and help bust traffickers.</p>\n<p>The species already has a strong track record in detection. The Belgian organization APOPO has been training their \"heroRATS\" to find land mines for 20 years, and it says the animals have helped clear more than 100,000 mines from former war zones. In the past decade, the rats have been used to detect tuberculosis, a highly infectious disease that public health facilities often miss. They can screen 100 mucus samples in 20 minutes — a job that would take clinics four days — and APOPO says they\'ve boosted TB detection by 40 percent at the clinics they work with.</p>\n<p>Now, with funding from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, the organization has begun training the keen-nosed rodents to help another animal — one at risk of going extinct. Demand for pangolins, reclusive animals that look like walking pine cones, is so great that some conservation groups say their populations in Africa and Asia have dropped 90 percent in the last decade. Smugglers often pack their dried scales with other pungent products, like coffee and wax, that can throw off detection dogs.</p>\n<p>The rats, which APOPO breeds at its headquarters in the city of Morogoro, are introduced to people when they\'re four weeks old. They\'re then trained for months using basic Pavlovian conditioning: The rat hears a click and gets a treat — avocado or banana — when it sniffs a target scent. Eventually, various scents are placed in holes, and the rodent gets the food reward when it stops and lingers over the target.</p>\n<img alt=\"(APOPO) An African giant pouch rat trains in Tanzania to detect land mines.\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PQRQDNRVNBDJNMUM5OQFTX7KNA.jpg\" width=\"1484\"><p>Using rats to ferret out pangolin could have advantages over other methods, said Cynthia Fast, APOPO\'s head of training and behavioral research. X-rays are used at some ports, but they\'re expensive and can bottleneck operations. Dogs sometimes struggle in withering heat and can contract some fly-borne diseases, but not the giant rats, Fast said. And while the rats can be very affectionate, they don\'t bond with individual handlers, making their training and deployment more seamless than that of detection dogs.</p>\n<p>\"They bond in general with people. If you come and visit our center, you see them following certain people around, not even on a leash. It\'s the cutest thing,\" Fast said. \"But they do it indiscriminately.\"</p>\n<p>The trainee rats have all been named after celebrity wildlife conservationists — one is Fossey (for Dian, the gorilla researcher); another is Betty White, after the actress and animal activist.</p>\n<p>The pangolin project has faced some challenges. For one, it\'s not easy to acquire pangolin parts to help the rats practice detection. APOPO had a lead on samples in South Africa, but securing the permits to get them across the borders — legally, that is — proved too big a hurdle, Fast said. The Tanzanian government also had some seized samples available, but they needed to be held until accused smugglers were prosecuted.</p>\n<p>At one point, a well-meaning local man showed up at the organization\'s office with a live pangolin he\'d found in the wild; he\'d heard about APOPO\'s program and thought they might know what to do with it, Fast recalled. The group handed the animal over to Tanzanian wildlife authorities, who released it in a protected area.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a pangolin at a zoo in Dar es-Salaam, Tanzania\'s former capital, died. Now its remains are being used to train the rats.</p>\n<p>Another complication is that pangolins are terribly pungent, with \"almost a fishy smell,\" Fast said. That is true both of the live animal that showed up on APOPO\'s doorstep and the scales that the researchers dried in the sun, Fast said.</p>\n<p>\"It was very challenging to dry them outside and not attract a bunch of different wildlife or flies, because they are so stinky,\" Fast said. It\'s not easy to find other similarly potent scents for use in training, she said, though dried fish is one possibility.</p>\n<p>\"You don\'t want them to miss actual samples that are being smuggled,\" Fast said of the rats. \"But you also don\'t want to have a high number of false alarms, where the rat says, \'Hey, there\'s pangolins here . . . just to find out it\'s a bunch of fresh fish.\"</p>\n<img alt=\"(APOPO) This African giant pouched rat is one of 11 being trained in Tanzania to detect the scent of pangolins, one of the world\'s most trafficked animals.\" height=\"3333\" src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YT2HIANGFZE3LLQ6YTZMSJLVFY.jpg\" width=\"5000\"><p>Fast said the pangolin-sniffing rats won\'t be put to work for another two to five years, and doing so will depend on what may be the most difficult step: Securing the cooperation of busy ports in Asia and Africa. The rats are also learning to detect shipments of ebony wood, which is illegally logged in Madagascar.</p>\n<p>Some day, Fast said, the sniffer rats might even be used to detect smuggled rhino horn, elephant tusks or lion bones.</p>\n<p>\"Here you have a rat working for fellow nonhuman animals. But it\'s also still helping people as well, because of lot of who is involved in illegal smuggling and trafficking is organized crime, and they\'re exploiting the local population,\" Fast said. \"This is one project where the rats are actually helping a lot of different levels of humanity.\"</p>\n',NULL,NULL,91,'28498335e40085b2c4a29809396edb13'),(233,'2017-12-24 22:41:57','Judge’s partial lift of Trump’s travel ban gives refugees hope they can reunite with their families','\n<p><b>Seattle</b> • After hearing heartbreaking stories of refugees who have struggled to reconnect with their families and li...','\n<p><b>Seattle</b> • After hearing heartbreaking stories of refugees who have struggled to reconnect with their families and listening to the plight of others who strive to leave dangerous situations, a federal judge said he would try to issue a ruling on a motion to block a Trump administration ban on refugees before Christmas.</p>\n<p>Late on the day before Christmas Eve, U.S. District Judge James Robart released a 65-page order that gave relief to both groups: He granted a nationwide injunction that blocks the administration\'s restrictions on the process of reuniting refugee families and partially lifted a ban on refugees from 11 mostly Muslim countries.</p>\n<p>Robart limited that part of the injunction to refugees who have a bona fide relationship with people or entities in the U.S. but said refugees who have formal agreements with refugee resettlement agencies or humanitarian organizations constitutes such a relationship.</p>\n<p>\"At stake in this decision is a question particularly poignant around the holidays — family reunification,\" said Mary Fan, a professor at the University of Washington Law School.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump restarted the refugee program in October \"with enhanced vetting capabilities.\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats also wrote a memo that specified the categories of the refugees who should be banned.</p>\n<p>The new executive order banned entry of spouses and minor children of refugees who have already settled in the U.S., referred to as \"follow-to-join\" refugees, and suspended the refugee program for people coming from 11 countries, nine of which are mostly Muslim.</p>\n<p>About 2,500 refugees in the U.S. are able to reunite with their families through the \"follow-to-join\" process, Robart said.</p>\n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union sued the administration on behalf of a Somali man, using the pseudonym Joseph Doe, who has spent years trying to bring his wife and children to his new home in Washington state. The ACLU case was consolidated with one filed by Jewish Family Service, which challenged the administration\'s prohibition of refugees from certain countries until the vetting process could be reviewed.</p>\n<p>Department of Justice lawyers argued in a hearing Thursday that the ban was a temporary and reasonable way for agencies to deal with gaps in the screening process. The restrictions were placed in the interest of national security, they said.</p>\n<p>But ACLU and Jewish Family Service lawyers said the process for implementing the ban violated the law.</p>\n<p>\"The ACLU\'s motion was focused on how particularly arbitrary the follow-to-join provision was, given that over 70 percent of those refugees are children under 16,\" said Tana Lin, ACLU of Washington cooperating attorney with the firm Keller Rohrback. \"Requiring special memos on preschool children like Joseph Doe\'s 4- and 5-year-old sons does not make our nation safer.\"</p>\n<p>Mariko Hirose, a lawyer on the Jewish Family Service case and litigation director for International Refugee Assistance Project, said the Trump administration has attacked refugee resettlement since the first travel ban, leaving vulnerable refugees in limbo.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs named in both lawsuits face difficult challenges.</p>\n<p>In addition to Joseph Doe\'s separation from his family, two Iraqi men who served as interpreters for the U.S. Army are in \"extreme danger\" because of their work. An Iraqi woman was kidnapped, raped and threatened with death for her work with an American company. And a transgender woman in Egypt faces harassment and persecution.</p>\n<p>They all were in the process of coming to the U.S. when the executive order went into effect.</p>\n<p>In issuing the injunction, Robart said the administration violated federal law by taking action and banning refugees from certain countries without going through the proper process.</p>\n<p>He also said the administration violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, passed by Congress.</p>\n<p>By using language in the act that mandated certain action, \"Congress created an entitlement for spouses and children of principal refugees to \'the same refugee status\' as the principal refugee — assuming the spouse and children are otherwise admissible,\" Robart said. \"Nothing in the statute authorizes the Secretary to stop, terminate, or suspend the ability of otherwise qualified applicants from seeking and obtaining that entitlement.\"</p>\n<p>Robart said he agrees that the government has a compelling interest in national security, but said the government failed to \"point to any specific national security threat that the agency memo curtails,\" while former national security officials have said they\'re unaware of any threat that would justify the ban.</p>\n<p>\"In fact, the former officials detailed concretely how the agency memo will harm the United States\' national security and foreign policy interests,\" Robart said.</p>\n<p>Department of Justice lawyers are reviewing the ruling and are evaluating the next steps, while Joseph Doe goes back to the process of reuniting with his loved ones.</p>\n<p>\"I am very happy that the judge recognized my right to have my family join me here in the United States, and I hope that they can come here as soon as possible,\" he said.</p>\n',NULL,NULL,91,'c6ca460e38c326daa7bb3bd4227dd0c7'),(234,'2017-12-24 22:15:07','Online shopping drives increased work for Utah, eastern Idaho carriers','\n<p><b>Idaho Falls </b>• There are many under-appreciated backstories to those working throughout the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Wh...','\n<p><b>Idaho Falls </b>• There are many under-appreciated backstories to those working throughout the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Whether it is the retail workers pulling extra shifts, or the law enforcement officers sacrificing time with their families, certain occupations bear the brunt of the madness that can be the holidays.</p>\n<p>But one occupation often goes unnoticed.</p>\n<p>With the rise of online shopping, delivery drivers are seeing increased hours and volume.

Its athletes aren’t shrouded behind masks, helmets or hats as in football, hockey and baseball, which has helped them become instantly recognizable celebrities, known around the world by an increasingly global audience. Even the figures powering the NBA, such as Commissioner Adam Silver, are familiar to casual fans.</p>\n<p>But there are faces you probably don’t know, the behind-the-scenes MVPs taking care of the details. They aren’t officially part of the league; they don’t sit on the bench at games or collect a check from teams. But these people, some you’ve perhaps never even heard of, have the players’ trust. And they wield a different kind of power: They are who NBA stars turn to when they just need to get stuff done.</p>\n<img alt=\'(Nick Otto | The Washington Post) Ronnie Singh, otherwise known as \"Ronnie2K,\" regularly engages with NBA players on social media to reveal - and debate - their rankings on the popular \"NBA 2K\" video games. John Wall is still smarting over an exchange earlier this year.\' height=\"4000\" src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QQ2D2KN2FJFRHITUUSWIU3KQLA.jpg\" width=\"6000\"><p>Who NBA stars see ... to complain about their ‘NBA 2K’ rating</p>\n<p>The kid holding the Stephen Curry jersey hangs over the railing and calls out his name. Another boy whose favorite player must be Kevin Durant — he is, after all, swimming in an oversized No. 35 jersey — extends a Sharpie for his autograph. But the Golden State Warriors stars aren’t anywhere near this tunnel leading to the Oracle Arena floor.</p>\n<p>Soon, an usher comes over to moderate the commotion as a 6-foot-5 man of Indian descent obliges the requests. He is the one they want. The man known as “Ronnie2K.”</p>\n<p>Ronnie Singh is a 35-year-old Bay Area native who holds every gamer’s dream job: digital marketing director for the “NBA 2K” video game series, the man who gets to announce the coveted ratings for each player.</p>\n<p>Singh builds the buzz over Twitter, rolling out stars’ rankings, though that can cause occasional confusion: Players sometimes mistakenly think he is the one to calculate their rating, which determine how good their avatar is in the game.</p>\n<p>“Dion Waiters,” Singh said with a sigh. “He’s definitely sensitive about the rating thing.”</p>\n<p>It’s actually Mike Staufferwho should be fielding the Miami Heat guard’s concerns, as he controls a player’s virtual appraisal. Stauffer once taught math to fourth- and fifth-graders and then transformed into “BEdwardsRoy19” on fan forums after school. Under that handle, a hat tip to then-Cleveland Browns wide receiver Braylon Edwards, Stauffer shared his own ratings system.</p>\n<p>“When I was bored, I would always be hopping on the video games,” said Stauffer, 27. “It almost became an obsession. It was just too much fun.”</p>\n<p>In 2014, the game’s developer, Visual Concepts, noticed Stauffer’s complex formulas and hired him as a game producer. Now working with a team, Stauffer labors over a formula based on 50 overall attributes to make up a single player’s rating.</p>\n<p>Singh and Stauffer, once just avid “2K” players, have helped launch the game into the mainstream. Since its Sept. 15 release, “NBA 2K18” ranks as the fastest-selling game in the title’s 18-year history with more than 5.5 million units purchased. With its realistic graphics and game play, its fan demographic stretches from young children to actual NBA players.</p>\n<p>“I definitely played it a lot,” said Atlanta Hawks rookie John Collins, a fan since he was 8. “Everybody wants that high rating.”</p>\n<p>Singh and Stauffer have contrasting personalities. Singh sits courtside at Warriors games, casually brags about the NBA players he has partied with and pulls out his phone to prove the famous Twitter accounts that have sent him direct messages.</p>\n<p>Stauffer works from home in Ohio, where his wife doesn’t like having two large TVs in the living room showing NBA League Pass.</p>\n<p>“But she understands,” Stauffer said.</p>\n<p>Singh no longer has such anonymity. When an NBA player wants his rating, he must hit up @Ronnie2K. According to Singh, two days before the game’s release, 214 players had tweeted about their initial ratings. That’s nearly half of the 450 players in the league. The game’s manufacturer didn’t have to spend a dime for the promotion.</p>\n<p>“Most other brands would struggle to have that kind of [advertising],” Singh said. “I mean, they’d have to pay considerably to have that kind of impact. We’re doing it based on relationships and a passion for a really great video game.”</p>\n<p>Singh knows how to get people talking, or more importantly, retweeting. After attending law school for a couple of weeks — Singh admits he would have made a “miserable lawyer” — he moved back to California and eventually took a job as the director of game operations for an independent professional baseball team, the San Diego Surf Dawgs. In that world, nothing was too crazy to get people talking, even if it meant signing disgraced former MLB player Jose Canseco.</p>\n<p>Singh has maintained this “any publicity is good publicity” theory when it comes to Twitter beefs.</p>\n<p>When Washington Wizards guard John Wall caught wind of his 90 rating, he tweeted at Singh: “u a joke !!” The two publicly debated about Wall’s previous ratings until Singh tweeted a GIF of a dancing salt shaker, poking fun at the four-time all-star for being upset. Wall blocked him.</p>\n<p>“John was not serious,” Singh said. “It was funny, him and I were DMing the whole time that was happening. It’s slightly orchestrated, you know. ... I didn’t know he was going to say ‘u a joke,’ but that was perfect. That was exactly what we needed to kind of fuel the thirst about these ratings.”</p>\n<p>Wall remembered things differently.</p>\n<p>“He just tried to say my rating was a 93 when it ended last year. No, it wasn’t. It was a 90. So what?” Wall said. “Then he going to send me a DM after it and like, ‘I’m just playing.’ I’m like, ‘Don’t try to be friendly with me.’ ”</p>\n<p>Only a few of the NBA players who obsess over their video game likeness and rating know Stauffer as the behind-the-scenes mastermind. He prefers it that way.</p>\n<p>Since those anonymous days on the Operation Sports forum when Stauffer was scoring downloads by building rosters, he has been content in simply improving the game. Now his ratings reach millions — even disgruntled NBA players.</p>\n<p>“I almost feel bad. I don’t want anyone to feel like they’re being slighted, and it’s just tough because most of the feedback is, ‘Oh, I should be much higher!’ ” Stauffer said. “We do put a lot of time into these formulas and we’re very proud of the results. At the end of the day, sometimes players aren’t going to feel like it portrays them accurately but we try our best and we’re always looking to improve also. ... When I see some of my favorite players in the league upset with their ratings, it’s hard to not have a conscience and feel a little bad.”</p>\n<img alt=\"(Jenna Schoenefeld | The Washington Post) Jhoanna Alba dresses more than 1,100 professional athletes in her designs, including reigning MVP Russell Westbrook, Wizards teammates John Wall and Bradley Beal, and basketball legend Magic Johnson.\" height=\"3648\" src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MUGXE26LKNEULJ67P2JGPZV5NI.jpg\" width=\"5472\"><p>Who NBA stars see ... to up their fashion game</p>\n<p>When Bradley Beal stepped into this grown man’s game, he was just a T-shirt and sweats kind of guy. An 18-year-old Beal wore sizes too big, the baggier the better. He owned one conservative suit, the kind that works well for a church pew on Sundays but not an NBA locker room on game days.</p>\n<p>Beal needed a style shift, someone to help him graduate from frumpy to fab. His Wizards teammate Wall knew just the woman to call — the designer whose custom looks hang in the closets of NBA stars, Jhoanna Alba.</p>\n<p>“I like her style. She kind of gets me out of my comfort zone,” Beal said. “She has some wild colors, she has some wild designs, and she has a great reputation of working with other guys in the league.”</p>\n<p>The NBA has embraced fashion more than any of the other major professional leagues. The players’ union presents an award for best dressed, and five current players appeared in this year’s edition of Sports Illustrated’s top 20 most fashionable athletes. Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook topped the list.</p>\n<p>Games have turned into red carpet events, as players strut from the team charter bus to the locker room, showing off trendy fashions. As the tripods turn to track their graceful moves, players hold distant stares like supermodels owning the runway at Fashion Week. Very often, they are wearing an ALBA original.</p>\n<p>“That’s the most important thing, is an image,” Wall said. “In the past, guys just wanted to come in wearing jerseys, wearing whatever, and that’s what they were accustomed to. ... That’s the kind of way I always liked to dress, but at the same time you’ve got to learn to go with both the casual side and the business side.”</p>\n<p>Alba, 45, who has clothed athletes and entertainers for 25 years and prefers the title of “chief visionaire” of the company that bears her last name, has so many NBA clients that she has lost count. With more than 1,100 professional athletes in ALBA designs, the list reads like an all-star roster.</p>\n<p>Alba knows Westbrook likes dress shirts impeccably tailored to show off every curve of his muscular frame.</p>\n<p>She understands Wall loves his favorite color so much that he would go for a bold look at the 2017 NBA Awards: an all-red suit that somehow stood out even in this couture-obsessed league.</p>\n<p>When Harrison Barnes was drafted by the Warriors in 2012 and wanted to carry on the North Carolina Tar Heels’ tradition of wearing suits and ties to games, Alba took 36 measurements to get his fit just right.</p>\n<p>“I was straight Men’s Wearhouse in college,” said Barnes, now with the Dallas Mavericks. “Now my closet is like an ALBA collection.”</p>\n<p>Growing up in Los Angeles, Alba learned to sew from her mother and designed her own prom dress. At 16, she began working at a tuxedo shop in Beverly Hills. Three years later, she became manager and soon landed the order that would change her life.</p>\n<p>In 1995, NFL quarterback Rodney Peete and actress Holly Robinson were getting married, and Alba was commissioned to dress the groomsmen — as well as the ring bearer, Earvin “E.J.” Johnson, son of NBA legend Magic Johnson. After the wedding, Alba remained friends with the Johnson family, calling “Mr. J” a mentor and making clothes for his wife, Cookie. Then, Magic made a bold suggestion: Start your own company. He ordered 10 custom suits, becoming the first ALBA client.</p>\n<p>“Jhoanna knows what’s in style and truly understands colors, cut of suits, and tailors the design to meet individual needs of her clients,” Johnson, now the Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations, wrote in an email. “She is a tireless worker who is personally involved in styling you from head to toe; and she always delivers on time.”</p>\n<p>Alba’s name quickly passed from one pro athlete to another. Her business skyrocketed, thanks in part to then-Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson.</p>\n<p>In 2005, as a response to Iverson’s influence on players wearing oversized throwback jerseys, pendant chains, do-rags and baggy jeans to arenas, the NBA implemented a “business casual” rule.</p>\n<p>“You had all the veterans buying the wardrobes for all the rookies to make sure the rookies were abiding by the dress code,” Alba said, then added with a laugh: “So that was a very good year for us.”</p>\n<p>More than just bespoke trousers and jackets, players are now breaking free from antiquated rules of jock fashion. They are wearing Euro-fitted shirts, short pants and garish patterns — clothes that once would seem outlandish even in 2003, when Alba designed Carmelo Anthony’s six-button, symmetrical suit for the draft.</p>\n<p>“Back then, when they were wearing the big, boxy suits, they wanted to look like Michael Jordan. They wanted to play like him ... and Michael Jordan was wearing the 24-inch shoulders,” Alba said. “Even Allen Iverson wanted the 24-inch shoulders, and he was probably an 18.</p>\n<p>“But then every year we just gradually went smaller and smaller and fit,” she continued. “Now it’s the tighter the better.”</p>\n<p>ALBA, which doubles as the acronym A Light Beyond Appearance, can be seen around the Wizards locker room on game days. Even several of Beal and Wall’s streetwear pieces come from the designer. Gone are the days of Beal’s extra-large sweatpants.</p>\n<p>“They’re excited to get dressed now,” Alba said of NBA players. “Fashion is big.”</p>\n<img alt=\"(Adam Glanzman| The Washington Post)  Rob McClanaghan believes players hiring trainers is &quot;a no-brainer to me. If you\'re going to spend money on other things, you need to spend money on that.&quot; He works with two-time MVP Steph Curry and John Wall, among others.\" height=\"3546\" src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S7ISXTJZRBDNJBUEPQAAPR5NNA.jpg\" width=\"5319\"><p>Who NBA stars see ... to get their bodies right</p>\n<p>They spend hours with the NBA’s upper crust, working out in closed gymnasiums through the summer and breaking down game footage in the fall and winter. Curry, Wall, Westbrook and other superstars won’t start a season without taking their tips.</p>\n<p>Employing specialized basketball trainers has become a prerequisite to a successful season — all the top players use them to correct jump shots, refine ballhandling and learn to harness speed and explosion.</p>\n<p>Most of these trainers have had undistinguished basketball careers of their own. They have not played in the NBA, nor do they work for a team. And yet, they hold as much influence as an NBA head coach.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been doing this a long time with a lot of guys,” skills trainer Rob McClanaghansaid, “and a lot of guys that I’ve trained have had — I don’t know, four to five coaching staffs. But I’ve been the one that’s been pretty much consistent through their whole career.”</p>\n<p>McClanaghan played three seasons at Syracuse, his best coming in 2000-01, when he appeared in 11 games and averaged 1.0 point. Still, this college backup helped revolutionize the NBA offseason.</p>\n<p>In 2008, the sports agency Wasserman Media Group hired McClanaghan, then a young college coach, as an in-house trainer charged with working out their soon-to-be rookie clients through the pre-draft process. Wasserman had signed seven of the top 15 picks — a list that included No. 1 selection Derrick Rose, Westbrook, Kevin Love and twin brothers Brook and Robin Lopez. By the next year, more agencies had brought in trainers, whose profiles grew even among veteran players who wanted to gain an edge over the summer.</p>\n<p>“I treat them like human beings and not NBA stars, and I hold them accountable probably more than anyone. If a guy’s five minutes late, I’m not happy,” said McClanaghan, 38, whose clients have included all-stars Wall, Westbrook and Durant. “Sometimes I get asked, ‘Why would they listen to you?’ And it’s a valid question. I guess my answer has always been, everything goes back to making them accountable.”</p>\n<p>Because the best trainers remain on call throughout the year, McClanaghan mulled over a tricky question: Who has more job security, a trainer or an NBA coach?</p>\n<p>“I think trainers have the ability to train 450 players,” McClanaghan said. “Unfortunately, for coaches it’s wins and losses sometimes. It is what it is. And I haven’t lost a game yet.</p>\n<p>“It’s safe to say as long as you’re working hard every day and maintaining the attitude of keeping [players] focused and tunnel vision of improving, it might be more stable,” McClanaghan continued. “So many great coaches get fired every year, and it sucks. But I have 450 players [who] can have the option to choose me if they want to, or any trainer, really. If one guy fires me, I have 449 more to hopefully get.”</p>\n<p>McClanaghan is one of several well-known skills trainers with a roster of players. Drew Hanlen claims Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid and Washington’s Beal and Kelly Oubre Jr. as a few of his Pure Sweat clients. Over the summer, New York-based Chris Brickley worked out with Anthony, and after he posted photos, the legend of “Hoodie Melo” grew on Instagram.</p>\n<p>As the founder of Accelerate Basketball, Brandon Payne has just one NBA client — Curry, the two-time most valuable player.</p>\n<p>Payne describes himself as a 6-foot-2 former Division II basketball player who was “as mediocre as mediocre gets.” His workouts with Curry, however, are anything but ordinary. Payne grew up in North Carolina and unlike most kids who wanted to fly like Air Jordan, he wanted to innovate like Tar Heels coach Dean Smith. During the 2011 NBA lockout, players around Charlotte flocked to his facility, and Payne met Curry. They started a relationship rooted in neuromuscular efficiency and cognitive development.</p>\n<p>For ballhandling drills, Curry dribbles in front of a wall of lights that shine in bright colors and instruct him to execute moves. Sometimes Curry wears a mask to deplete the oxygen in his brain so that both it and his heart rate will elevate to game levels without putting miles on his body.</p>\n<p>“Nothing we do is because it looks cool or nothing we do is done for social media,” said Payne, who moves to the Bay Area every summer to work with Curry. “Everything that I do is done because it fits. It’s got purpose.”</p>\n<p>In a sign of the significance of today’s NBA offseason, Curry doesn’t just work with Payne. McClanaghan capped a busy September day — evaluating game footage for Orlando Magic guard Elfrid Payton — by preparing for a flight across the Atlantic Ocean to join Curry for a promotional trip. The NBA star wanted to get in another workout before the start of training camp.</p>\n<p>“You need a nutritionist, a strength coach and a basketball trainer,” McClanaghan said. “Players need to invest in that. It’s a no-brainer to me. If you’re going to spend money on other things, you need to spend money on that.”</p>\n<p>McClanaghan doesn’t reveal how much he charges his clients — “I make a living, and that’s it” — but by the looks of his schedule, he stays in high demand. His London trip with Curry followed a visit to Washington, where he put Wall through a 90-minute session on the guard’s 27th birthday.</p>\n<p>McClanaghan challenged Wall on his change of pace, elbow and midrange jumpers and shooting off the dribble. He’ll challenge clients in other ways, too. How many other former college bench-riders get away with cursing out and trash-talking NBA superstars?</p>\n<p>“I talk trash to all my guys all the time. I know all their stats,” McClanaghan said. “They’ll talk trash to me and I’ll be like: ‘You had 40 last night. You must have a good trainer.’ ”</p>\n',NULL,NULL,91,'0da0f91918748ed80471d17c9bee393e');
